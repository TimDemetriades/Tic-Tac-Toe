# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic-tac-toe game made with Python. It could be a lot shorter but it works so it'll do.

To play, run the file **TicTacToe.py**. 'X' makes the first move. It will ask you where you would like to start. Please enter as x and y coordinates from 1 to 3 seperated by a space. For example, if you would like to place the X in the center, enter `2 2`.

Turns will switch from 'X' to 'O' until either one player wins or there is a draw. Enjoy!
